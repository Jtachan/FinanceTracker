Alternatively, clone the repository and install it locally:
```commandline

Once launched, the tool will create a file "finance.db" at the current working directory.

The tool has a minimal UI by ussing the terminal.
The UI is accessible via the following call:

```

The minimal UI is defined by a menu of valid operations to perform.

The data visualization at this mode is either by selecting options 2 or 3, which will print a table over the terminal (as shown in the following images);
or by option 6, displaying graphical plots over a locally hosted HTML page.

See the section ['Plots'](#plots) for more information about the option 6.
